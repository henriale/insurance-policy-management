Part 1: RESTful API Implementation (75 minutes)

Objective: Develop a RESTful API service using Typescript and a preferred framework (e.g., Nest.js, Express) that simulates insurance policy management.
Tasks:

Design endpoints to manage (create, read, update, delete) insurance policies.
Implement basic authentication to secure the API.
Incorporate middleware for logging and error handling.
Ensure the API connects with a mock database (Postgresql or a NoSQL option).

Part 2: Backend Infrastructure Design (45 minutes)

Objective: Design the backend infrastructure for a system that aggregates and processes data from multiple insurance carriers.
Task:

Sketch a scalable backend architecture including data integration points, API services, and database design.
Highlight how the design supports scalability, reliability, and data consistency.
Mention potential use of Google Cloud services for enhancing the infrastructure.

Submission Requirements:

You should use a Git repository for code submission, including clear README instructions for setup and testing.
System design diagrams can be submitted as a PDF or image file, with explanations included in the document or as part of the repository's documentation.
BOTH submissions need to be explained via a loom video or similar. Also, be prepared for followup questions by recruiter or our client hiring manager.
